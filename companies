<h3><u>Procedure for ITC Infotech campus placement</u></h3><strong>I</strong>. First, you have the <strong>Online Written Test</strong> usually conducted by AMCAT which has a time limit of maximum 40 minutes where a candidate needs to answer 25 questions. Further, ITC Infotech written test is divided into 3 sections. The details are as following:<br/><br/><strong>1. Quantitative Skills</strong>: This section comprises of questions based on PNC, number series, analytical puzzles, time, speed and distance, ratio and proportions (alligations/mixtures etc) and probability. The time allotted for this section is 15 minutes and you might be asked around 5 to 10 questions at max.<br/><br/><strong>2. Reasoning Ability</strong>: This section consists of questions based on data interpretation, syllogism, data arrangement, statement reasoning, data sufficiency (Pie chart/Bar chart/Tables) etc. The time allotted for this section is 15 minutes. Focus on solving the set-based questions first, because if you are able to crack the logic, then 3-4 questions will be solved in a go. This would give you huge advantage in terms of time over other candidates. The individual questions can be solved next and each should take maximum of 2 minutes.<br/><br/><strong>3. Verbal Proficiency</strong>: This section includes 1 long and 1 short reading comprehension passage, totalling upto 10-12 questions. The verbal ability section also consists of grammatical questions such as fill in the blanks (3-5), sentence correction (3), theme detection (1-2) etc. The time allotted for this section is 10 minutes. The trick is to answer the sentence correction (prepositions, conjunctions, tenses), error spotting and vocabulary based questions in the beginning. Next, solve the reading comprehension by finding answers to the questions directly rather than reading the whole passage. There might be questions based on critical reasoning, though rarely asked, it is better to be prepared for the same.<br/><br/>An important point to note is that there is no negative marking for the online test, however there is a sectional cut-off. The overall level of ITC Infotech written test is moderate and a well prepared candidate will find it a breeze to clear the exam. <br/><br/><strong>II</strong>. The second round is Group Discussion and you should be prepared with the latest current affairs topics and news in the business/tech world. One must try to pitch in 2-3 valid points during the course of GD and also summarise at the end to ensure a sure shot chance for the further rounds. Only those who have cleared the online screening test and Group Discussion will sit for the next round, i.e., Technical Interview round - so do not forget to go through latest ITC Infotech placement papers PDF for complete preparation.<br/><br/><strong>III</strong>. Further, we move on to the <strong>Technical Interview</strong> round where the initial questions asked are about the projects and internship(s) you have done during the engineering course. After that the interview will test you on your programmings skills - this would consist of questions ranging from basic theory such as C, C++, DBMS, Operating Systems to Networking, OOPS concepts and a programming language of your choice.<br/><br/><strong>IV</strong>. The final stage in the ITC Infotech placement process is the <strong>HR Interview</strong> round and as expected, this round consists of questions based on your resume, job role and sometimes trivia about ITC Infotech also.
